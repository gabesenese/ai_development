                             - Wake Word Detection

#### Tech

- [Python] - Basic program interface, framework, dataset and libraries

- Wake word and voice recognition: Implement a wake word detection system that activates the assistant when a specific phrase is spoken, such as "Hey {AI's Name}." For voice recognition, I was thinking of using speech recognition APIs or frameworks like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Mozilla DeepSpeech but I decided to create my own.

- Text-to-speech synthesis: Find a text-to-speech (TTS) engine that can convert the assistant's responses into natural-sounding speech. Popular options include Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech but again decided to program my own TTS .

- Customization and personalization: In the beginning I am planning to use a single voice but later on I will consider allowing myself to personalize their assistant by choosing a preferred voice, or adjusting settings according to my preferences, maybe.

- Context and conversation management: Designing an assistant to maintain context throughout the conversation. This will enable it to understand follow-up questions or commands based on previous interactions. Contextual understanding can be achieved through techniques like dialog state tracking or maintaining a conversation history.

- Integration with smart home devices: If I want my virtual assistant to control smart home devices, research and integrate with compatible platforms or APIs like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit.

- Machine learning and AI capabilities: The assistant will need to learn and improve over time, I have to explore incorporating machine learning techniques. For example, use reinforcement learning to optimize responses based on user feedback or implement natural language understanding models to improve intent recognition.

- Security and privacy: Ensure to take appropriate measures to protect user data and maintain privacy. Implement secure communication protocols, use encryption where necessary, and be transparent about the data the assistant collects and how it is used.
